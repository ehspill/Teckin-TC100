At the end of the normal Bootprocess when anyka_ipc is launched, the app first checks for the existence of a file (/mnt/enable_telnetd.dat) and decrypts it using 3DES.

If decryption succeeds, the decrypted content is saved to /tmp/autoexec.sh, and the original file is removed from the SD-card.
The decrypted script is then executed using ak_cmd_exec().


It sets the default return value (ret) to -1, indicating failure by default.
Reads up to 4096 bytes (0x1000) of encrypted data into the buffer cipher.
If fewer than 8 bytes are read, it prints an error and returns -1.
Key and IV: The script uses the same hardcoded key (123 padded with zeros) and IV (0x1234567890ABCDEF).
Padding: The plaintext is padded to ensure its size is a multiple of 8 bytes (the block size for DES3). This is required for CBC mode.
